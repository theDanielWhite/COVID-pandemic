<h1>Coronavirus Disease 2019<h1>

<h2>Symptoms of Coronavirus<h2>

<h3>What you need to know<h3>

<h4>

* Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms.

* **Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions** like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. <h4>

<h3>Watch for symptoms<h3>

<h4>People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.

Symptoms may appear **2-14 days after exposure to the virus.** People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
* Fever or chills
* Cough
* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
* Fatigue
* Muscle or body aches
* Headache
* New loss of taste or smell
* Sore throat
* Congestion or runny nose
* Nausea or vomiting
* Diarrhea

This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. <h4>

<h3>When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention<h3>

<h4>

Look for **emergency warning signs\*** for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, **seek emergency medical care immediately**
* Trouble breathing
* Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
* New confusion
* Inability to wake or stay awake
* Bluish lips or face

*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.

**Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility:** Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19. <h4>

<h2>Testing<h2>

<h3>Testing for COVID-19<h3>

<h4> 
[Guidance on Interpreting COVID-19 Test Results](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Testing-Guidance.pdf): A guide for interpreting test results and determining what actions to take.

Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: [viral tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html) and [antibody tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html).
* A viral test tells you if you have a current infection.
* An antibody test tells you if you had a previous infection.

An antibody test may not be able to show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks after infection to make antibodies. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus can protect someone from getting infected with the virus again, or how long that protection might last. <h4>

<h3>Who should be tested<h3>

<h4>To learn if you have a current infection, viral tests are used. But not everyone needs this test.

* Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.
* CDC has [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) and [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health departments or healthcare providers.
* If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.
* You can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing.
* Although **supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.** <h4>

<h3>Results<h3>

<h4>

* **If you test positive for COVID-19 by a viral test,** know what protective steps to take [if you are sick or caring for someone](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html).
* **If you test negative for COVID-19 by a viral test,** you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19, no matter the type of test, you still should take preventive measures to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).

<h3>Test for Current Infection<h3>

<h4>

Viral tests check samples from your respiratory system (such as swabs of the inside of the nose) to tell you if you currently have an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Some tests are point-of-care tests, meaning results may be available at the testing site in less than an hour. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once received by the lab.

<h4>

<h3>How to decide if you should get a viral test<h3>

<h4>

Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. Here is some information that might help you make decisions about getting a viral test.
* Most people have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. They may not need to be tested.
* At this time, there is no treatment specifically approved for people who have COVID-19.

CDC has [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and local health departments or healthcare providers.
<h4>

<h3>How to get a viral test<h3>

<h4>

COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. You can also visit your [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) or [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. Although **supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.**

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized two viral tests that let you collect either a [nasal swab](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-test-patient-home-sample-collection) or a [saliva sample](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-diagnostic-test-using-home-collection-saliva) at home. However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
<h4>

<h3>What to do after a viral test<h3>

<h4>

To get your test result, please check with the group that performed your test, such as your healthcare provider or your health department. Check the CDC website to [locate your health department information](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html). How long it will take to get your test results back depends on the test used.

* **If you test positive for COVID-19,** know what protective steps to take [If You Are Sick or Caring for Someone](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html).
* **If you test negative for COVID-19,** you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. It is possible that you were very early in your infection when your sample was collected and that you could test positive later. Or you could be exposed later and then develop illness. In other words, a negative test result does not mean you won’t get sick later. This means you could still spread the virus.

<h2>Test for Past Infection<h2>

<h4>

Antibody tests check your blood by looking for antibodies, which can show if you had a past infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibodies are proteins that help fight off infections and usually provide protection against getting that disease again (immunity). Antibodies are disease specific. For example, measles antibody will protect a person who is exposed again to measles but will have no effect if the person is exposed to mumps.

Depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current COVID-19 infection. Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose COVID-19. To see if you are currently infected, you need a [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html). Viral tests identify the virus in samples from your respiratory system, such as swabs from the inside of your nose.

> **If you test positive or negative for COVID-19 on a viral or an antibody test, you still should take preventive measures to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).**
> 
> **We do not know yet if people who recover from COVID-19 can get infected again.  Scientists are working to understand this.**
<h4>

<h3>How to get an antibody test<h3>

<h4>

Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one.
<h4>

<h3>What do your results mean?<h3>

* <h3>If you test positive<h3>
    <h4>

    * A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19, or possibly from infection with a related virus from the same family of viruses (called coronavirus), such as one that causes the common cold.
    * We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 can protect someone from getting infected again or, if they do, how long this protection might last.
    * Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means. Your provider may suggest you take a second type of antibody test to see if the first test was accurate.
    * You should continue to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/index.html) since it’s possible you could get infected with the virus again.
    * **If you have no symptoms**, you likely do not have an active infection and no additional follow-up is needed.
        * If you work in a job where you wear personal protective equipment (PPE), continue wearing PPE.
    * **If you have [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)** and meet other [criteria for testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html), you would need another type of test called a [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html). This test identifies the virus that causes COVID-19.
        * This test uses respiratory samples, such as a swab from inside your nose, to confirm COVID-19.
        * An antibody (blood) test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.
    * You might test positive for antibodies even if you never had symptoms of COVID-19. This can happen if you had an infection without symptoms (also called an asymptomatic infection).
    <h4>

* <h3>If you test negative<h3>
    <h4>

    * You may not have had COVID-19 before. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means.
    * You could still have a current infection.
        * The test may be negative because it typically takes 1 to 3 weeks after infection to develop antibodies. It’s possible you could still get sick if you have been exposed to the virus recently. This means you could still spread the virus.
        * Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people may not develop antibodies.
    * **If you have [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)** or develop symptoms after the antibody test and you meet other [criteria for testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html), you would need another type of test called a [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html). This test uses respiratory samples, such as a swab from inside your nose, to confirm COVID-19. An antibody (blood) test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.

Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).

<h3>CDC's work in antibody testing<h3>

<h4>

**CDC is evaluating commercial antibody tests**

CDC is collaborating with other government agencies to [evaluate the performance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/serology-testing.html) of commercially manufactured antibody tests. Some of these tests have received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

For more information:

* [FDA Emergency Use Authorizations for COVID-19](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd)
* [Insight into FDA’s Revised Policy on Antibody Tests: Prioritizing Access and Accuracy](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/insight-fdas-revised-policy-antibody-tests-prioritizing-access-and-accuracy)
* [EUA Authorized Serology Test Performance](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/eua-authorized-serology-test-performance)

**CDC is conducting [serologic surveillance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/serology-surveillance/index.html)**

CDC is looking at [data from antibody tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/serology-testing.html) to estimate the total number of people who have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 in the United States. CDC is also using antibody testing to learn more about how the body’s immune system responds to the virus and to explore how the virus spreads among people exposed to it. The information CDC is looking at comes from many groups, including blood donors and household contacts of people who had symptoms and were diagnosed with COVID-19.

CDC is supporting [state, local, tribal and territorial laboratory capacity](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/laboratory.html).
